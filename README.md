# Try to modify the decoder in sketch_rnn with WTA algorithm

★ Most of the changes of code were in model.py

★ The trained model data were saved in /test_model

★ I downloaded 2 new datasets cow.npz and crab.npz, which are stored in /dataset/quickdraw as the original repo suggested

★ You might want to run test.ipynb to see the result

The original repo is here: https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/sketch_rnn
